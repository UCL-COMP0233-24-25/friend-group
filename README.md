# A group of friends

We will use this repository to see different ways of representing a group of
friends and acquaintances in Python.

# The setting

Work with a partner to design a data structure to represent a group of
acquaintances using dictionaries and lists.
- Each person in the group has a name.
- Each person in the group has an age.
- Each person in the group can have a job.
- Each person can be connected to others in different ways, such as "friend", "granddaughter", "colleague" etc.
